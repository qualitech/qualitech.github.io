products1_description:
  - Monitor the % RH, surface and air temperature, % moisture in the air (% RH) which affect substrate and applied coating
  - Substrate test for contaminants such as moisture, salts, etc.; compare degree of cleanliness with standards
  - Measure the surface profile of prepared substrates using digital gauges or comparison with standards
  - Measure thickness of applied while wet to predict the dry film thickness to maximize protection and effective cost
  - Measure dry film thickness of coating, galvanizing, plating for ferrous and non-ferrous metals and concrete substrates
  - Check for flaws in the applied coatings such as pinholes, air or contaminants entrapped and holidays on applied paints
  - Test bonding strength of the applied coating over substrate, or prior coats; test cohesion strength of coating or substrate
  - Monitor soundness of structure by ultrasonic measuring the thickness even for inaccessible spots or through coatings
  - Metal locators such as rebars, studs, etc. on concrete; testing compression strength of concrete

products1_description-legacy:
  - A range of instruments designed to measure climatic conditions during the coating process.
  - A range of products designed to quickly and accurately assess surface cleanliness before application of coating.
  - A range of digital and mechanical surface profile gauges and surface comparators for measuring surface profile.
  - A range of products for measuring uncured wet film thickness and powder thickness for high quality finish and minimal waste.
  - A comprehensive range of Dry Film Thickness gauges to meet all of your coating inspection requirements.
  - A range of versatile pinhole &amp; porosity detectors designed to meet the most exacting specifications.- Adhesion testers are used to verify that both surface preparation and coating application are within specification.
  - A range of ultrasonic thickness gauges which can be used for fast and accurate thickness measurements on a variety of materials.
  - Whether you are trying to determine a rebar’s location, depth, diameter and orientation or its potential for corrosion using half-cell, the Elcometer range of concrete inspection equipment is required.
