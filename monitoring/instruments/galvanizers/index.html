products1_description:
  - To monitor the temperature in the oven during curing of applied powder coating
  - Non-contact measurement of the thickness of uncured powder coat material
  - Measure thickness of dry and cured powder coating, hot dipped galvanizing, electroplating, galvanizing, etc.
  - Measure the glossiness of cured paints and coating
  - Test the physical properties of cured coating like hardness deformation, flexibility, and impact resistance
  - Measure adhesion strength on substrate using digital instruments or mechanical methods of cross hatch, etc.


products1_description-legacy:
  - Easy to use oven temperature profile solution for a quality finish and a successful cure of a powder coating.
  - A comprehensive range of Dry Film Thickness gauges to meet all of your coating inspection requirements.
  - A range of versatile pinhole &amp; porosity detectors designed to meet the most exacting specifications.
  - Adhesion testers are used to verify that both surface preparation and coating application are within specification.
  - When the quality &amp; finish of a surface is important, Elcometer’s range of Gloss, %Reflectance, DOI &amp; Colour meters accurately determine the surface appearance.
  - Ideal in the development, formulation &amp; manufacturing of a coating, whether measuring the fineness of grind, applying a uniform film thickness, testing a coating’s elasticity, hardness, abrasion or impact resistance, Elcometer’s range of high quality physical test equipment is essential.
